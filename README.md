🎮 CodeAlpha Hangman Game

A simple text-based Hangman Game developed in Python as part of the CodeAlpha Python Programming Internship.

The player attempts to guess a randomly selected word one letter at a time, with a maximum of 6 incorrect guesses.

📌 Project Overview

The Hangman Game is a console-based Python application that demonstrates fundamental programming concepts.

The program randomly selects one word from a predefined list of five words. The player then guesses individual letters until the complete word is discovered or the maximum number of incorrect guesses is reached.

🎮 How the Game Works
1. Select a Word

The program randomly selects a word from five predefined words.

2. Hide the Word

The letters are initially displayed as underscores.

Example:

_ _ _ _ _ _
3. Guess Letters

The player enters one letter at a time.

Example:

Guess a letter: p
Correct guess!
4. Track Incorrect Guesses

If the entered letter does not exist in the secret word, the incorrect-guess counter increases.

The maximum number of incorrect guesses is 6.

5. Determine the Result

The player wins when all letters are correctly guessed.

Otherwise, the game ends after six incorrect guesses.

▶️ Demo
Example Gameplay
================================
       HANGMAN GAME
================================

Guess the word one letter at a time!
You have 6 incorrect guesses.

Word: _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _

Guess a letter: c
Correct guess!

Word: c _ _ _ _ _ _ _

Guess a letter: x
Wrong guess!

Incorrect guesses: 1 / 6

The player continues guessing until the word is successfully discovered or six incorrect guesses are made.
